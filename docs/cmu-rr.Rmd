## Data

We merged three data sets together in order to complete this analysis. 
Unfortunately, one source is proprietary and we can't share the three raw data
sets. However, we are able to share the final merged version. 

```{r data}
df <- readRDS("../data/bangs-merged-final.rds") %>%
  mutate(has_bangs = if_else(has_bangs == "y", "Yes", "No"))
```
